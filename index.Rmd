## Welcome to My Website!

I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Jeremy Guest](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jsguest)'s [research group](https://engineeringforsustainability.com/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://cee.illinois.edu/)). I also did my Master's degree with Professor Guest at UIUC. My research is supported by the DOE Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation ([CABBI](https://cabbi.bio/)). I received my Bachelor's degree from [Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/majors-departments/civil-environmental-engineering), and am a registered Engineer in Training (E.I.T.) in the state of Pennsylvania. My contact information can be found at the top right of the navigation bar, feel free to reach out!

## What am I working on right now?

Right now I'm in the midst of finishing up my first first-author manuscript where I explore the influence of a biorefinery's location on its financial viability. I'm planning to present my work at the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) Research and Education conference in June.
