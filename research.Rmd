## Interests & Current Research

Broadly, I am interested in renewable energy sources and the interactions between technology and public policy. My current research explores the influence of a biorefinery's location on its financial viability and the environmental impacts of the fuel it produces using techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA). I also evaluate the efficacy of existing state-level bioenergy policy incentives via TEA and LCA to inform the development of future public policy. I am finishing up my first manuscript so that I can post more about it here. You can read this [brief profile](https://cabbi.bio/dalton-stewart-economics-and-environment-both-vital-to-sustainability/) of my work that CABBI published back in 2020, and please refer to my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w_vTjaIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) for the most up to date list of my publications.

## Policy and Research Legislative Fellowship

The goal of my research with Senator Bennett's Office is to determine what effect, if any, the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) is having on electricity prices in Illinois. CEJA was enacted in September 2021, and is meant to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from the energy and transportation sectors in Illinois with an emphasis on an equitable transition. To do so, CEJA contains several provisions that will phase out fossil fuel electricity sources, expand renewable energy generation, and expand economic opportunities for disadvantaged communities and communities affected by the transition away from fossil fuels. CEJA requires Illinois to achieve a 100% zero-emission power sector by 2045, but some critics have suggested that CEJA is responsible for the ongoing (as of January 2023) spike in electricity prices in Illinois. My research during summer 2022 explored the interplay between the specific provisions of CEJA and electricity prices and other global factors influencing electricity prices. I found that spiking electricity prices are due to issues with electricity supply, rather than CEJA. The results of my research are now being used by the Office of Senator Bennett to communicate with constituents about CEJAâ€™s impacts and the causes of the electricity price spike. I am also helping to develop legislation to assist low-income residents with their electricity bills and will continue to explore how Illinois' transition to electric vehicles will affect revenue for infrastructure maintenance.

## Undergraduate Research

As an undergraduate at Bucknell University, I was very fortunate to work with [Dr. Deborah Sills](https://www.bucknell.edu/fac-staff/deborah-sills) on a research project where we investigated the distribution of manure from high-density poultry operations in southeastern Pennsylvania. My job was to contact local County Conservation Districts to get access to manure production records, then record the amounts and locations of manure production at various farms. We collaborated with researchers affiliated with the Geisinger Health System to find that people living closer to such poultry operations were at increased risk of contracting certain illnesses.
